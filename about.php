      <h1>My name is <span>Ivana Tumbeva</span></h1>
      <p>
        I have been a family and portrait photographer for 5 years,
        capturing genuine emotions and timeless moments. Since 2022, I have
        been studying photography at Griffith College Dublin, continuously
        refining my skills and artistic vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a photographer, I am deeply passionate about capturing raw emotions and the unspoken beauty of human connection. 
        Portrait and family photography allow me to freeze moments of love, laughter, and vulnerability, turning them into timeless memories. 
        Through my lens, I strive to reveal not just faces, but the depth of feelings that make each person unique. 
        Photography, to me, is more than an art—it’s a way to honor relationships, preserving the warmth of a touch or the sparkle in someone’s eyes.
